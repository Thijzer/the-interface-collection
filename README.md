# The.Interface.Collection

This repository is reserved for Interfaces only.
It's designed to support Generic Interfaces that could work cross repo's.
It's not meant to replace anything, I just to like to repeat myself on interfaces.

# Bridging Interfaces
Sometimes people can't agree on a single interface and even truly so it's dependable on the project those interfaces should work on.
For that we allow some form of bridging, by separation of concern, find whats common and redefine nested Interfaces.
